# Supershop Management System

The Supershop Management System is a comprehensive desktop application designed to manage the various aspects of a supershop. An admin user can log in to the system and perform various operations related to buyers and products. This application is primarily developed using Java Swing. It is the final project I worked on for the Object-Oriented Programming Lab course.
